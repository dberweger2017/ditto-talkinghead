Client secrets
REST API endpoint to generate ephemeral client secrets for use in client-side applications. Client secrets are short-lived tokens that can be passed to a client app, such as a web frontend or mobile client, which grants access to the Realtime API without leaking your main API key. You can configure a custom TTL for each client secret.

You can also attach session configuration options to the client secret, which will be applied to any sessions created using that client secret, but these can also be overridden by the client connection.

Learn more about authentication with client secrets over WebRTC.

Create client secret
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/client_secrets
Create a Realtime client secret with an associated session configuration.

Request body
expires_after
object

Optional
Configuration for the client secret expiration. Expiration refers to the time after which a client secret will no longer be valid for creating sessions. The session itself may continue after that time once started. A secret can be used to create multiple sessions until it expires.


Show properties
session
object

Optional
Session configuration to use for the client secret. Choose either a realtime session or a transcription session.

Maximum number of output tokens for a single assistant response, inclusive of tool calls. Provide an integer between 1 and 4096 to limit output tokens, or inf for the maximum available tokens for a given model. Defaults to inf.

model
string

Optional
The Realtime model used for this session.

output_modalities
array

Optional
Defaults to audio
The set of modalities the model can respond with. It defaults to ["audio"], indicating that the model will respond with audio plus a transcript. ["text"] can be used to make the model respond with text only. It is not possible to request both text and audio at the same time.

prompt
object

Optional
Reference to a prompt template and its variables. Learn more.

Client events
These are events that the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket server will accept from the client.

session.update
Send this event to update the session’s configuration. The client may send this event at any time to update any field except for voice and model. voice can be updated only if there have been no other audio outputs yet.

When the server receives a session.update, it will respond with a session.updated event showing the full, effective configuration. Only the fields that are present in the session.update are updated. To clear a field like instructions, pass an empty string. To clear a field like tools, pass an empty array. To clear a field like turn_detection, pass null.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event. This is an arbitrary string that a client may assign. It will be passed back if there is an error with the event, but the corresponding session.updated event will not include it.

session
object

Update the Realtime session. Choose either a realtime session or a transcription session.

}
input_audio_buffer.append
Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later commit. A "commit" will create a new user message item in the conversation history from the buffer content and clear the buffer. Input audio transcription (if enabled) will be generated when the buffer is committed.

If VAD is enabled the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server will decide when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer manually. Input audio noise reduction operates on writes to the audio buffer.

The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum of 15 MiB, for example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the VAD to be more responsive. Unlike most other client events, the server will not send a confirmation response to this event.

audio
string

Base64-encoded audio bytes. This must be in the format specified by the input_audio_format field in the session configuration.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type
string

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.append.

{
    "event_id": "event_456",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.append",
    "audio": "Base64EncodedAudioData"
}
input_audio_buffer.commit
Send this event to commit the user input audio buffer, which will create a new user message item in the conversation. This event will produce an error if the input audio buffer is empty. When in Server VAD mode, the client does not need to send this event, the server will commit the audio buffer automatically.

Committing the input audio buffer will trigger input audio transcription (if enabled in session configuration), but it will not create a response from the model. The server will respond with an input_audio_buffer.committed event.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type
string

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.commit.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.commit
{
    "event_id": "event_789",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.commit"
}
input_audio_buffer.clear
Send this event to clear the audio bytes in the buffer. The server will respond with an input_audio_buffer.cleared event.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.clear.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.clear
{

}
conversation.item.create
Add a new Item to the Conversation's context, including messages, function calls, and function call responses. This event can be used both to populate a "history" of the conversation and to add new items mid-stream, but has the current limitation that it cannot populate assistant audio messages.

If successful, the server will respond with a conversation.item.created event, otherwise an error event will be sent.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item
object

A single item within a Realtime conversation.


Show possible types
previous_item_id
string

The ID of the preceding item after which the new item will be inserted. If not set, the new item will be appended to the end of the conversation. If set to root, the new item will be added to the beginning of the conversation. If set to an existing ID, it allows an item to be inserted mid-conversation. If the ID cannot be found, an error will be returned and the item will not be added.

type

The event type, must be conversation.item.create.

OBJECT conversation.item.create
{
  "type": "conversation.item.create",

}
conversation.item.retrieve
Send this event when you want to retrieve the server's representation of a specific item in the conversation history. This is useful, for example, to inspect user audio after noise cancellation and VAD. The server will respond with a conversation.item.retrieved event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item_id
string

The ID of the item to retrieve.

type
string

The event type, must be conversation.item.retrieve.

OBJECT conversation.item.retrieve
{
    "event_id": "event_901",
    "type": "conversation.item.retrieve",
    "item_id": "item_003"
}
conversation.item.truncate
Send this event to truncate a previous assistant message’s audio. The server will produce audio faster than realtime, so this event is useful when the user interrupts to truncate audio that has already been sent to the client but not yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there is not text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

If successful, the server will respond with a conversation.item.truncated event.

audio_end_ms
integer

Inclusive duration up to which audio is truncated, in milliseconds. If the audio_end_ms is greater than the actual audio duration, the server will respond with an error.

content_index
integer

The index of the content part to truncate. Set this to 0.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item_id
string

The ID of the assistant message item to truncate. Only assistant message items can be truncated.

    "audio_end_ms": 1500
}
conversation.item.delete
Send this event when you want to remove any item from the conversation history. The server will respond with a conversation.item.deleted event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item_id
string

The ID of the item to delete.

type

The event type, must be conversation.item.delete.

OBJECT conversation.item.delete
{
    "event_id": "event_901",
    "type": "conversation.item.delete",
    "item_id": "item_003"
}
response.create
This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses automatically.

A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the conversation history by default.

The server will respond with a response.created event, events for Items and content created, and finally a response.done event to indicate the Response is complete.

The response.create event includes inference configuration like instructions and tools. If these are set, they will override the Session's configuration for this Response only.

Responses can be created out-of-band of the default Conversation, meaning that they can have arbitrary input, and it's possible to disable writing the output to the Conversation. Only one Response can write to the default Conversation at a time, but otherwise multiple Responses can be created in parallel. The metadata field is a good way to disambiguate multiple simultaneous Responses.

Clients can set conversation to none to create a Response that does not write to the default Conversation. Arbitrary input can be provided with the input field, which is an array accepting raw Items and references to existing Items.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

response.cancel
Send this event to cancel an in-progress response. The server will respond with a response.done event with a status of response.status=cancelled.

conversation.item.added
Sent by the server when an Item is added to the default Conversation. This can happen in several cases:

When the client sends a conversation.item.create event.
When the input audio buffer is committed. In this case the item will be a user message containing the audio from the buffer.
When the model is generating a Response. In this case the conversation.item.added event will be sent when the model starts generating a specific Item, and thus it will not yet have any content (and status will be in_progress).
The event will include the full content of the Item (except when model is generating a Response) except for audio data, which can be retrieved separately with a conversation.item.retrieve event if necessary.

conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed
This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the user audio buffer. Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is committed by the client or server (when VAD is enabled). Transcription runs asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after the Response events.

Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model. The transcript may diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.

input_audio_buffer.speech_started
Sent by the server when in server_vad mode to indicate that speech has been detected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the buffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this event to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user.

The client should expect to receive a input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event when speech stops. The item_id property is the ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event (unless the client manually commits the audio buffer during VAD activation).

audio_start_ms
integer

Milliseconds from the start of all audio written to the buffer during the session when speech was first detected. This will correspond to the beginning of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the prefix_padding_ms configured in the Session.

event_id
string

The unique ID of the server event.

string

The ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops.

input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped
Returned in server_vad mode when the server detects the end of speech in the audio buffer. The server will also send an conversation.item.created event with the user message item that is created from the audio buffer.

audio_end_ms
integer

Milliseconds since the session started when speech stopped. This will correspond to the end of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the min_silence_duration_ms configured in the Session.

event_id

    "audio_end_ms": 2000,
    "item_id": "msg_003"
}
input_audio_buffer.timeout_triggered
Returned when the Server VAD timeout is triggered for the input audio buffer. This is configured with idle_timeout_ms in the turn_detection settings of the session, and it indicates that there hasn't been any speech detected for the configured duration.

The audio_start_ms and audio_end_ms fields indicate the segment of audio after the last model response up to the triggering time, as an offset from the beginning of audio written to the input audio buffer. This means it demarcates the segment of audio that was silent and the difference between the start and end values will roughly match the configured timeout.

The empty audio will be committed to the conversation as an input_audio item (there will be a input_audio_buffer.committed event) and a model response will be generated. There may be speech that didn't trigger VAD but is still detected by the model, so the model may respond with something relevant to the conversation or a prompt to continue speaking.

audio_end_ms
integer

Millisecond offset of audio written to the input audio buffer at the time the timeout was triggered.

audio_start_ms
integer

Millisecond offset of audio written to the input audio buffer that was after the playback time of the last model response.
